# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Union Model**. We implement and solve the trade union model as presented in Introducing Advanced Macroeconomics, Growth and Business Cycles by SÃ¸rensen and Whitta-Jacobsen (2010) focusing on the partial equilibrium on industry level.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages. The notebook leans on code provided in modelproject.py
