This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 


2. Data project. We fetch data from **FRED** and analyze how mispricing in the financial sector affects real investments in the U.S. We find that the elasticity of investment with respect to market valuation is more than 5 times higher when changes in market valuation reflect changed fundamentals, compared to when they do not.


3. Model project. We implement and solve the trade union model as presented in Introducing Advanced Macroeconomics, Growth and Business Cycles by Sørensen and Whitta-Jacobsen (2010) focusing on the partial equilibrium on industry level.
