# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Tobins q - data project**. In the proejct we replicate the main analysis in our bachelor thesis "Tobin's Q - Quotable or Questionalble?". Buidling on the work of Blanchard, Rhee and Summers (1993) and looking at the U.S non-financial sector, we investigate whether mispricing in the financial markets has important implications for the real economy. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. Data from FRED using an API 
1. BRS data.xlsx. Previously available from: https://economics.mit.edu/faculty/blanchar/papers. Link has experied since we did our BA. We only use the data for comparission and our analysis does not depend on it.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
