    "In this project we will replicate the main analysis in our bachelor thesis \"Tobin's Q - Quotable or Questionalble?\". Buidling on the work of Blanchard, Rhee and Summers (1993) and looking at the U.S non-financial sector, we investigate whether mispricing in the financial markets has important implications for the real economy. In our bachelor thesis, we collected all the needed data from Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED) manually and made computations in Excel. The focus of the project is to simplify this process massively by getting the data from FRED using an API, clean it and make computations in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "The work builds on Tobin's q theory. Tobin's q is the market value of assets (MV) divided by the replacement cost of those assets (K), $ q = \\frac{MV}{K} $ and is theoretically a predictor of investments: if q is above one, firms should increase their investments as the cost of aquiring new assets is lower than their value after installed in the firm. The q can be divided into the products of two terms where FV is fundamental value:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ q = \\frac{MV}{FV}\\frac{FV}{K} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first term is the ratio of market value to fundamental value and can be interpreted as the degree of mispricing. The second term is fundamental q. We analyze if investments responds to changes in fundamental q, mispricing or both by regressing the ratio of investments (I) to the replacement cost of capital (K) allowing for both terms of q to enter seperately. We run our regressions using the first difference of the natural logarithm of the variables. We substitue $\\frac{MV}{FV}$ with q. Hence our regression will look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta \\ln\\left(\\frac{I}{K}\\right) = \\alpha + \\delta_1\\Delta \\ln\\left(\\frac{MV}{FV}\\frac{FV}{K}\\right) + \\delta_2\\Delta \\ln\\left(\\frac{FV}{K}\\right) + \\epsilon $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = \\alpha + \\delta_1\\Delta \\ln\\left(\\frac{MV}{FV}\\right) + (\\delta_1+\\delta_2)\\Delta \\ln\\left(\\frac{FV}{K}\\right) + \\epsilon $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the coefficient on q will capture the sensitivity of investment to misvaluation while the sum of the coefficient on q and $\\frac{FV}{K}$ will capture the sensitivity of investment to changes in q not caused by misvaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, the project will proceed as follows. First we will read the data for the construction of q and $\\frac{I}{K}$ and compute them. Then we will read data for a proxy for $\\frac{FV}{K}$ and compute the proxy. Then we will compare our variables with those found by Blanchard, Rhee and Summers (1993). Finally we will run our regression analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "We run our regression on yearly data. Data from FRED is a mix of quaterly and yearly data and is reported in either million or billions of U.S dollars. Thus, we will make various convertions underway. "

    "In following code will retrive data for the market value of long term debt and compute it. We net out all long term interest bearing claims on the asset side from long term claims on the liability side to get the book value of long term debt. We then convert the book value of long term debt (BVLD) to market value of long term (MVLD) debt by calculating the present value of the streams of coupon payments on the debt and the repayment of the principal a maturity. The principal equals BVLD and coupon payments are net interest paid (NIP) in the sector. We assume a constant maturity (t) of 10 years and use an average of Moody's AAA and BAA corporate bond yield as the discount factor (r). The discountfactor is multiplied by 0.5 and rasied to power of 2t as most U.S corportate bonds have coupon bonds semiannualy:\n",
